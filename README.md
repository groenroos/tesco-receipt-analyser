# Tesco receipt analyser

Little dumb dohickey to convert your Tesco GDPR data into a table of products, sorted by total spend.

1. Get your [Tesco JSON](https://www.tesco.com/account/data-portability/en-GB/), and put in the repo root as `data.json`.
2. `npm ci`
3. `node index`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
